## Tasks: Sheldon Ebron

### Task 1: Send Private Message between Vendor and Renter
- Description: Create a Conversation model and a message model. For each of these models; there will need to be an associated controller, _form.html.erb(+new/edit), show.html.erb, seeds, validations, validation tests. The way that the Conversation model and Message model will be created based on the Class Diagram, (see Class Diagram), implies that every connection between two users is a conversation and an element in the Conversation model. Each component of the Conversation model will be associated with all the messages between the two users in the Message model.
- How to Evaluate: As a user, when on the vehicle detail page (see UI Sketch for Vehicle_details) there is a negotiation button that will take the user to the private messaging tab on the account page (see UI Sketch for  Private_Messaging). This page will display all of the userâ€™s conversations, and when selecting a conversation, the user will be able to view and message the other user in the conversation.
- Outcome of Task:  In the Private Messaging pages, the user can create a conversation and send messages between users. However, all the functionality is not all on one page like the UI Sketch for Private_Messaging. Instead, it consists of multiple views because of the messaging logic. This is why there was a need to modify the class diagram and add a model named conversation. This was necessary to keep track of messages between users in a conversation. However, in iteration 2, I will be able to modify the current Private Messaging task to resemble the Private Messaging UI Sketch.
