Task 1: User Story Cleanup and Additions
Description: Add any additional user stories to ensure the project scope is well rounded. Clean up descriptions of the tasks.
How to Evaluate: The user stories document (see userstories_RentACar.md) should follow the format specified in the instructions. Also, the descriptions should be clear.
Outcome of Task: I made the changes other teams suggested at the peer review including cleaning up the titles and descriptions so they followed the correct format. I also started thinking about what tasks would need to be done for each user story (see userstories_taskplanning.md) so we would have something to build on in our planning meeting. This led me to add several additional user stories to round out the functionality.
