## Tasks: Katie Bridson

### Task 1: User Story Cleanup and Additions
- Description: Add any additional user stories to ensure the project scope is well rounded. Clean up descriptions of the tasks.
- How to Evaluate: The user stories document (see [userstories_RentACar.md](https://github.com/memphis-cs-projects/comp7012-Rent-a-Car/blob/master/planning/Project_Artifacts/UserStories/userstories_RentACar.md)) should follow the format specified in the instructions. Also, the descriptions should be clear.
- Outcome of Task: I made the changes other teams suggested at the peer review including cleaning up the titles and descriptions so they followed the correct format. I also started thinking about what tasks would need to be done for each user story (see [userstories_taskplanning.md](https://github.com/memphis-cs-projects/comp7012-Rent-a-Car/blob/master/planning/Project_Artifacts/UserStories/userstories_taskplanning.md)) so we would have something to build on in our planning meeting. This led me to add several additional user stories to round out the functionality.

## Tasks: Senjuti Dutta

### Task 1: Sitemap
- Description: Visual or textually organized model of a Web site's content.
- How to Evaluate: The sitemap (see [Sitemap_v1.1.pptx](https://github.com/memphis-cs-projects/comp7012-Rent-a-Car/blob/master/planning/Project_Artifacts/SiteMap/Sitemap_v1.1.pptx))should be clear and easy to understand  whole website view.
- Outcome of Task: Sitemap is used during the planning of a Web site .I made the sitemap using powerpoint that refers to that pages of the website that redirects to another page or refers to a new/ edit form so that the this visual representation gives a clear idea of the website.

## Tasks: Sheldon Ebron

### Task 1: Class Diagram
- Description: I created a class diagram that will intuitively correlate with the user stories.
- How to Evaluate: The class diagram document (see [RentACar_ClassDiagram_v1.1.jpg](https://github.com/memphis-cs-projects/comp7012-Rent-a-Car/blob/master/planning/Project_Artifacts/ClassDiagrams/RentACar_ClassDiagram_v1.1.jpg)) should be clear and easy to understand while following the MVC class diagram format.
- Outcome of Task: I created the class diagram originally using powerpoint, and following a Rent-A-Car group discussion Katie Bridson suggested that I use yuml which is a way to generate a class diagram programmatically. This made the diagram cleaner and also will allow for the diagram to quickly scale up in the future, if needed.
